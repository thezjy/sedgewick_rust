Some Data Structures and Algorithms from the book [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) implemented in Rust.

To run the code you need to download the test data files (which I don't include in this git repo cause it's too big) from the book site and unzip it in the root directory as `algs4-data`.

The code here is either complete or optimal. It's soley for learning. Maybe I will make it good enough to brag about someday.
